# r-functions
This repository contains functions I have written in R.

'pollutantmean', 'complete' and 'corr' were written as part of the week 2 course work for the John Hopkin's Data Science course.
They work on the data contained in the zip file 'specdata'; which contains pollution monitoring data.
